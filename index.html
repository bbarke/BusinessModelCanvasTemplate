            <h4>Key Partners</h4>
            <p>Our key partners would be the community that develops extensions for Google Chrome.</p>
            <p>The key resources we obtain from that community would be the code, examples, and knowledge to create theis extentsion</p>
            
            </p>

          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Key Activities</h4>
            <p>Distribution channels - Google Chrome extensions</p>
            <p>It would need to be distributed in a way others can easily obtain it.</p>
            <p>It would solve the problem of people reading your email messages</p>

          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Value Proposition</h4>
            <p>
				The value we deliver to the customer is safety to their messages to make sure 
				only the intended viewers can view the page

          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Customer Relationship</h4>
            <p>Each customer must realize the importance of keeping their information safe.</p>
            <p>There are free RSA libraries for encryption, so that will keep the cost down</p>
            <p>The major cost here is time</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Customer Segments</h4>
            <p>We are creating value for those that want to keep their information safe. </p>
            <p>To prevent others from viewing their sensitive information</p>

          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Key Resources</h4>
            <p>A huge key resource here would be Google Chrome. It is the program we are
			creating the extension for</p>
			<p>Another key resource is time. We need to put in the time to create this extension</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Channels</h4>
            <p>We can reach our customers though the internet, on websites that promote encryption.</p>
            <p>The most cost effective channel is though free postings on RSA websites.</p>
			<p>Currently, people are unaware that their information is being stored and viewed by others.</p>
			<p>
				The channel that works the best is one where people are already seeking security, 
				but we would need to reach to other channels as well to help those that do not know about 
				their information being stored.

        <tr>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Cost Structure</h4>
            <p>The most important cost structure is time.</p>
            <p>
				Since this is a class project, we are essentially paying for this extension to be built, but maybe 
				people on the web will donate to our cause?
			</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
            <p>I believe people would pay a little money for a great encryption extension. However, most of the chrome extensions are free.</p>
            <p>To create revenue, however, we could place a donate box on the page they retrieve the extension from</p>
