            <h4>Key Partners</h4>
            <p>Our key partners would be the community that develops extensions for Google Chrome.</p>
            <p>The key resources we obtain from that community would be the code, examples, and knowledge to create this extension</p>
            
            </p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Key Activities</h4>
            <p>Distribution channels - Google Chrome extensions</p>
            <p>It would need to be distributed in a way others can easily obtain it.</p>
            <p>It would solve the problem of people reading your email messages</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Value Proposition</h4>
            <p>
				The value we deliver to the customer is safety to their messages to make sure 
				only the intended viewers can view the page
			</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Customer Relationship</h4>
            <p>Each customer must realize the importance of keeping their information safe.</p>
            <p>There are free RSA libraries for encryption, so that will keep the cost down</p>
            <p>The major cost here is time</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Customer Segments</h4>
            <p>
				Personal messages can and are being intercepted by others. 
				This is where we come into play, to prevent this from happening.
				Encryption is the key in making your information is safe. 
			</p>
			<p>We want to work hard to help the customer feel secure. That is our goal.</p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Key Resources</h4>
            <p>A huge key resource here would be Google Chrome, since we are creating this extension for this browser</p>
			<p>Another key resource is time. We need to put in the time to create this extension</p>
			<p>The CryptoJS3.1 library from Google would be a huge resource to make this all happen. It is a library built in JavaScript (the language that is required for creating an extension).</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Channels</h4>
            <p>We can reach our customers though the internet, on websites that promote encryption.</p>
            <p>The most cost effective channel is though free postings on RSA websites.</p>
			<p>
				Currently, people are unaware that their information is being stored and viewed by others. A way to reach these people would be by public 
				advertisement, but this may be out of the reach of this class
			</p>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Cost Structure</h4>
            <p>The most important cost structure is time.</p>
            <p>
				Since this is a class project, we are essentially paying for this extension to be built, but maybe 
				people on the web will donate to our cause?
			</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
            <p>I believe people would pay a little money for a great encryption extension. However, most of the chrome extensions are free.</p>
            <p>To create revenue, however, we could place a donate box on the page they retrieve the extension from</p>
